# HebrewScript

## Get hebrew text from latin characters
An easy way to use your latin keyboard to type in hebrew script.
Developed with ReasonML

## Usage

Refer to the table of correspondence to type the desired chars.

After a time this will become quite natural, and you will no longer need to refer to the tables.
