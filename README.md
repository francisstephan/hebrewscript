# HebrewScript

## Get hebrew text from latin characters

An easy way to use your latin keyboard to type in hebrew script.
Developed with ReasonML, using BuckleScript and webapi.

## Usage

Refer to the table of correspondence to type the desired chars.

After a time this will become quite natural, and you will no longer need to refer to the tables.

## Development

We relied on the book "Web Development with ReasonML" by J.David Eisenberg, The Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2019

For string manipulation, we used the Js library, mainly:

- https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/api/js/string-2 ,

- https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/api/js/dict and:

- https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/api/js/array-2

For comparison's sake, the same type of software was developed:

- using clojurescript : https://github.com/francisstephan/farsiscript

- using elm : https://github.com/francisstephan/arabicscript

- using scalajs : https://github.com/francisstephan/pashtoscript
